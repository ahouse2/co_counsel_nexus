# Archived Reference Assets

This directory collects legacy or vendor-specific reference material that remains available for historical context but is not required for day-to-day development.

## Contents

- `Reference Code/` &mdash; Original vendor sample projects and experimental notebooks used during early R&D. The implementations are superseded by the production `backend/` and `frontend/` stacks but retained for traceability.

## Guidance

- Do not modify these assets unless you are explicitly curating historical material.
- When referencing snippets in documentation, link to the production modules instead of the archived copies whenever possible.
- New reference dumps should follow the `archive/YYYY-MM-DD_reference-assets/` pattern with an accompanying `README.md` describing provenance and scope.
