- ## Activities
  - Implemented ACE retriever, planner, and critic Python modules with schema validation and artefact persistence.
  - Authored JSON Schemas and documentation updates aligning blueprint with concrete tooling.
  - Provisioned GitHub Actions reusable workflows orchestrating Retriever → Planner → Critic sequence for PRs.
  - Added targeted pytest suite covering command runner behaviour, schema validation, and critic evaluation.

- ## Evidence
  - Code: tools/ace/**/*.py, docs/schemas/ace/*.json, .github/workflows/ace_*.yml.
  - Documentation: docs/roadmaps/2025-11-03_ace_system_implementation_plan.md, docs/validation/2025-11-02_phase1_quality_review.md (Implementation Notes).

- ## Validation
  - Executed `pytest tools/tests -q`.

- ## Outcomes
  - ACE pipeline generates retriever/planner/critic artefacts under build_logs with JSON schema guarantees.
  - Pull requests targeting main now trigger ACE validation pipeline with gating thresholds.
  - Updated ACE plan ledger noting completion of implementation milestones.
