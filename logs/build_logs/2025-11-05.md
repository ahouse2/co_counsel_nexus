# Build Log — 2025-11-05

- **Scope:** PRP Phase 3 GraphRAG integration — triple extraction, ontology seeding, hybrid retrieval.
- **Highlights:**
  - Added rule-based triple extractor with entity normalisation and ontology seeding via `GraphService`.
  - Threaded graph mutations through ingestion manifests, exposing graph counts in `/ingest/{job_id}` status payloads.
  - Enriched `/query` hybrid retrieval with graph-driven summaries and combined trace outputs.
- **Tests:**
  - `pytest backend/tests -q`
- **Notes:**
  - Triple extraction heuristics prioritise legal verbs (`acquired`, `filed a lawsuit against`, `merged with`, etc.) and dedupe by `(subject, predicate, object)` with per-document evidence tracking.
  - Ontology bootstrap seeds `OntologyRoot` plus `Organization`, `Person`, `Location`, `Event` classes for both Neo4j and in-memory modes.
