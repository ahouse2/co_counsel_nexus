# 2025-11-10 — QA Gate Implementation Log

## Summary
- Added reusable quality gate CLI (`tools/qa/quality_gate.py`) enforcing ≥85% coverage on backend suites.
- Authored comprehensive unit tests for the gate, storage/credential utilities, graph service, and forensics branches to raise coverage.
- Recorded validation artefacts (roadmap, validation memo) and executed coverage run achieving 85.37%.

## Timeline
1. Installed updated dependencies including `coverage==7.6.4`. 【f603a6†L1-L31】
2. Authored and executed new tooling/unit tests. 【fcac7d†L1-L12】【b86edf†L1-L13】
3. Expanded backend tests covering storage, timeline, credentials, graph (Neo4j stub), forensics (PDF/DOCX/high-res image), raising coverage. 【6b9aec†L1-L2】
4. Executed backend regression suite post-expansion. 【6b9aec†L1-L2】
5. Ran quality gate verifying tests + coverage exceed threshold. 【eb5bc4†L1-L3】

## Metrics
- Backend tests: 44 passed. 【6b9aec†L1-L2】
- Tools tests: 14 passed (existing warnings acknowledged). 【b86edf†L1-L13】
- Quality gate: PASS @ 85.37% coverage. 【eb5bc4†L1-L3】

## Notes
- Forensics coverage improvements relied on lightweight PDF/Docx fixtures; no external binaries required.
- Neo4j branch coverage simulated via deterministic driver/session stubs.
- Quality gate JSON export available via `--json-output`; not persisted in this run.
