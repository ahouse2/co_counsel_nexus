## Summary
- Delivered OneDrive ingestion connector with OAuth token exchange, paginated traversal, and retry envelope aligned to PRP spec.
- Authored regression coverage for S3, SharePoint, and OneDrive connectors using deterministic fixtures and stubs.
- Repaired retrieval graph pagination regression and aligned timeline timezone guard test with security headers.

## Timeline
1. Installed backend runtime dependencies to satisfy optional security and telemetry modules. 【96649f†L1-L21】
2. Implemented OneDrive connector logic, updated retrieval graph paging, and exercised targeted connector suite. 【600705†L1-L2】
3. Executed full backend regression with PYTHONPATH primed to confirm system-wide stability. 【7489f9†L1-L10】

## Metrics
- Connector tests: 5 passed. 【600705†L1-L2】
- Backend test suite: 60 passed. 【7489f9†L1-L10】

## Notes
- Timeline timezone-aware filter now enforces naive timestamp requirement behind authenticated requests to satisfy security middleware.
- OneDrive connector warnings surface when drives contain no downloadable files, preserving ingestion diagnostics.
