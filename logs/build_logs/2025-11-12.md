## Summary
- Replaced telemetry exporter-based tests with recording stub harness covering retrieval and forensics instrumentation pathways.
- Authored completion roadmap documenting telemetry closure tasks and validation checkpoints.
- Re-ran backend regression suite to confirm telemetry refactor preserved functionality.

## Timeline
1. Drafted Phase 8 telemetry completion plan capturing environment priming, stub harness design, and regression sweep requirements.
2. Implemented recording tracer/meter harness in telemetry tests, asserting span attributes and metric calls without external exporters.
3. Executed `pytest backend/tests -q` with repository root on `PYTHONPATH` to validate entire backend suite. 【cf1651†L1-L11】

## Metrics
- Backend tests: 48 passed. 【cf1651†L1-L11】

## Notes
- Recording harness patches service-level tracers and metrics, enabling deterministic assertions without relying on SDK exporters.
- Continue running pytest with `PYTHONPATH=.` to guarantee repository packages resolve correctly across environments.
