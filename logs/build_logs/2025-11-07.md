- **Highlights:**
  - Added `AgentsService` orchestrating research → forensics → QA pipeline with telemetry metrics and persisted threads.
  - Exposed `/agents/run` and `/agents/threads/*` endpoints with Pydantic models, storage backing, and deterministic QA scoring.
  - Authored rubric heuristic harness ensuring ≥7.0 per-category scores, updated roadmap/tasks, and documented review follow-ups.
- **Tests:**
  - `pytest backend/tests/test_api.py -q`
  - `pytest backend/tests/test_forensics.py -q`
  - `pytest backend/tests/test_agents.py -q`
- **Notes:**
  - Agent threads persisted under `storage/agent_threads/<thread>.json` including telemetry (durations, artifacts, QA averages).
  - QAAgent heuristics documented in roadmap; follow-up tasks captured in `docs/validation/2025-11-07_prp_status_review_tasks.md`.
