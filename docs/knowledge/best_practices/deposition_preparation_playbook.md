# Deposition Preparation Playbook

## Clarify objectives and theories
- Identify the top five thematic goals for the witness (e.g., liability admission, damages mitigation, credibility attack).
- Draft a working outline linking each theme to exhibits and anticipated testimony citations.
- Align with trial strategy by reviewing prior interrogatory responses and key pleadings for consistency gaps.

## Equip the witness
- Conduct a structured prep session covering procedural rules, objection handling, and pause discipline.
- Role-play difficult questioning styles (rapid-fire, compound, hostile) and rehearse bridge statements back to key themes.
- Provide a curated exhibit packet with annotations, highlighting timeline anchors and numerical calculations the witness must master.

## Manage exhibits and technology
- Pre-mark exhibits when rules permit; otherwise, maintain a tabbed binder with electronic backups in PDF form.
- Test the remote platform (Zoom, Teams) 48 hours before the deposition, including screen-sharing, audio devices, and breakout rooms for caucuses.
- Prepare a real-time chat channel for the legal team to flag follow-up questions without distracting the lead examiner.

## Capture testimony effectively
- Assign a second-chair attorney or paralegal to take contemporaneous issue-coded notes and track impeachment opportunities.
- Time-stamp critical admissions and note references to external documents for follow-up subpoenas or requests.
- Request on-the-record clarifications when answers are ambiguous; avoid letting harmful testimony stand unchallenged.

## Post-session follow-through
- Debrief within two hours to catalogue admissions, inconsistencies, and exhibits for supplemental discovery.
- Update the case timeline and trial notebook, linking transcript excerpts to motion or cross-examination outlines.
- Issue reminders for any undertakings made during the deposition (e.g., document supplementation, privilege log updates).
