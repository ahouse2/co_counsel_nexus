# Privilege Log Quality Manual

## Establish privilege criteria
- Document controlling doctrines for attorney-client, work-product, and common-interest protections at matter kickoff.
- Define minimum data elements for every entry (author, recipients, date, privilege basis, description, document type).
- Maintain a decision tree for grey-area documents (e.g., dual-purpose communications, third-party consultants).

## Build a defensible workflow
- Capture metadata during collection to avoid manual re-entry and reduce transcription errors.
- Flag potentially privileged hits during review using structured issue codes and automated keyword reports.
- Require second-level review for any document withheld solely under common-interest doctrine.

## Draft precise descriptions
- Use action-oriented phrases ("seeking legal advice regarding export controls") while avoiding legal conclusions.
- Reference litigation phases or project names instead of specific legal advice to preserve privilege.
- Limit descriptions to 20–30 words; longer entries increase the risk of privilege waiver.

## Validate the log before production
- Run automated checks for duplicates, missing fields, and inconsistent privilege bases.
- Spot-audit 5% of entries manually, ensuring the description matches source content and privilege rationale.
- Confirm Bates ranges referenced in the log align with withheld documents and production indices.

## Handle challenges proactively
- Prepare a briefing packet summarising privilege standards, key entries, and supporting case law citations.
- Offer to re-review or supplement entries within 48 hours of receiving a deficiency letter.
- Track meet-and-confer outcomes, updating the privilege log and audit trail to reflect agreed-upon modifications.
