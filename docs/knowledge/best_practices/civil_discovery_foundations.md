# Civil Discovery Foundations

## Build an actionable discovery plan
- Map custodians, data sources, and temporal scope within the first 72 hours of engagement.
- Document anticipated objections and proportionality arguments aligned with Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).
- Establish a communication cadence with opposing counsel that includes weekly status emails summarising collection, review, and production progress.

## Preserve data defensibly
- Issue litigation holds within 24 hours of matter intake, tracking acknowledgements and reminders.
- Partner with client IT to suspend auto-deletion and confirm backup retention for cloud collaboration tools (e.g., M365, Slack, Teams).
- Maintain a preservation log noting system toggles, responsible personnel, and validation screenshots.

## Collect with repeatable workflows
- Prioritise targeted collections before full-disk imaging to minimise volume and reduce privilege exposure.
- Leverage API-based collections for SaaS platforms where available; document scope and connector limitations.
- Capture metadata (hashes, timestamps, sender/recipient) during export, and verify against chain-of-custody manifests before ingesting to review platforms.

## Review for relevance and privilege
- Create issue codes mapped to key allegations; ensure each review batch has QC spot-checks by a senior attorney.
- Track decision rates (relevant/not relevant/needs further review) daily to recalibrate batching and staffing.
- Escalate any documents implicating regulatory investigations to the response team within four hours.

## Produce with transparency
- Confirm Bates ranges and confidentiality designations before production; double-check file counts against load-file manifests.
- Provide privilege log excerpts with each production tranche to reduce downstream disputes.
- Summarise production contents for stakeholders, including key documents, volume metrics, and next production targets.
