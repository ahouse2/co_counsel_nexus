## Summary
- Implemented threaded ingestion queue with idempotent tracking and graceful shutdown hooks, refactoring the ingestion service to enqueue jobs while preserving manifest semantics.
- Added asynchronous ingestion lifecycle tests plus updated API regressions to poll job manifests, ensuring failure paths surface via job status instead of synchronous responses.
- Documented execution plan and status checklist updates for PRP Phase 10, refreshing roadmap and validation artefacts.

## Timeline
1. Authored ingestion worker module and refactored service enqueue/process separation, introducing lifecycle guards and queue exceptions.
2. Integrated FastAPI startup/shutdown worker management and expanded configuration for queue capacity/concurrency.
3. Updated tests to await job completion, created async regression suite, and executed targeted async tests. 【b84a02†L1-L32】
4. Ran full backend regression suite to validate asynchronous ingestion flow with updated expectations. 【fd1b23†L1-L36】

## Metrics
- Async worker tests: 2 passed. 【b84a02†L1-L32】
- Backend test suite: 62 passed. 【fd1b23†L1-L36】

## Notes
- Ingestion validation scenarios now return 202 Accepted; failure diagnostics are available via job manifests and status polling rather than immediate HTTP errors.
- Worker handler suppresses HTTPException propagation so queue logs remain focused on unexpected crashes while manifests retain failure context.
