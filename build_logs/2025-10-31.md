# Build Log — 2025-10-31

Goals
- Establish validation matrix for PRP_Forensics_Core with explicit test suites across unit, integration, and E2E layers.
- Capture success metrics and dataset dependencies to enforce measurable acceptance criteria.

Actions
- Authored `PRP_Forensics_Core_validation_matrix.md` alongside the PRP with requirement-to-test mapping, success metrics, and dataset inventory.
- Linked the matrix to accountability metrics (citation precision, timeline accuracy, forensics completeness) and ensured suites emit telemetry hooks.

Next
- Implement the referenced test suites and seed datasets so CI can enforce the defined success metrics.
