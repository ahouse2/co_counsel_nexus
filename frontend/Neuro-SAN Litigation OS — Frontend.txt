Neuro-SAN Litigation OS — Frontend Specification (Rev. 11/17)

A cinematic, immersive, halo-based interface for AI-driven legal discovery.

1. Core Design Language
1.1 Visual Style

Overall aesthetic: Cinematic dark-mode, inspired by your reference image (Autoneum acoustic simulator).

Palette:

Background: charcoal/near-black gradient with subtle atmospheric noise.

Highlights: neon electric blue, soft white glow, and optional green-gold accents for legal/evidence states.

Motion:

Smooth orbital UI animations, like rotating around a holographic sphere/halo.

Modules illuminate when hovered—pulsing glow effect identical to your reference.

Typography:

All-caps headings with letter spacing (e.g., “SELECT A MODULE”).

Slim, modern sans-serif body text (think Inter, Eurostile, or Exo).

2. Halo Interaction Model (The Central Paradigm)

The Halo is a circular UI element dominating the screen.
It contains:

Left Perimeter: Primary Modules (Nodes)

Each module sits as a glowing orbital node on the left side of the halo.
On hover: inner glow brightens + label fades in.
On select: node connects to halo with a line and activates central viewport.

Primary Modules:

Graph Explorer

Evidence Ingestion Pipeline

AI Context Engine

Legal Theory Team

Forensics / Chain of Custody

Timeline Builder

Exhibit / Trial Binder Creator

Mock Trial Arena

Trial University

Live Co-Counsel Chat

Legal Research / Case Law Engine

These must be arranged vertically but following the halo curvature.

Right Perimeter: Submodules / Tools

When a primary module is selected, the right perimeter populates with the context-appropriate submodules (each a smaller glowing node).

Examples:

Graph Explorer

Vector Space View

Structured Graph View

Relationship Heatmap

Autonomous Query Panel

Agent Interaction Overlay

Evidence Ingestion Pipeline

Folder Upload

OCR + Embedding

Metadata Verification

Fault Tolerance Logs

File Hashing / Dedup

Vector DB Sync

Neo4j Sync

Legal Theory Team

Fact Pattern Extraction

Legal Element Linking

Context Generation

Assertion / Counterassertion Engine

Strategy Drafting

Mock Trial Arena

AI Critic Combat

Witness Simulation

Attack/Defense Passes

Trial Scripts

Legal Research

Case Law Search

Precedent Extraction

Statutes & Codes

CourtListener API Integration

Knowledge Graph Sync

3. Center Viewport (Inner Halo)

This is the focus view.
When a module or submodule is selected:

The viewport gently animates in from a blurred holographic state.

Provides a full-screen mini-app inside the circular boundary.

Can zoom in/out depending on context:

Chat viewer zooms into conversations.

Graph explorer zooms out toward the stars.

Upload pipeline zooms into a terminal-style UI.

Viewport rules:

Should never break the circular boundary.

If content is rectangular (chat or documents), apply masked circular cropping or rounded vignette effect.

4. Global UI Elements
Top-Right: Menu Button

Three-line “MENU” text-style button (same design as reference)

Opens a slide-out panel with global navigation & user account settings.

Bottom-Right: Settings Cog

Opens provider/API configuration panel (LLMs, embeddings, OCR, courtlistener API key, storage options, etc.)

Should match the glowing neon outline style.

Bottom-Left: Contact / About / App Diagnostics

Minimal understated text link area (“CONTACT US”, logs, diagnostics).

5. Chat, Multi-Agent Visualization & Live Co-Counsel
5.1 Global Chat Viewer & Co-Counsel Avatar

A module that visualizes:

Agent teams (Forensics, Legal Theory, Research, etc.)

Their message exchanges

Thread timelines

Document references

Interaction Patterns

When user selects a team → viewport zooms into a micro-conversation room.

Agents represented by:

Floating avatars

Orbs / nodes

Or short vertical bars (like Discord voice channels)

Modes

Overview Mode: All teams interacting, flowing like a moving galaxy.

Focus Mode: Drill into one team’s conversation (LLM to LLM).

Thread View Mode: Chat messages line up as vertical stacked cards that fade in/out.

6. Timeline Builder

Core Requirements:

Drag-and-drop timeline nodes

Each node contains:

Timestamp

Factual summary

Evidence citations

“Open Document Viewer” button

When clicked, documents slide in from right side within the halo as a circular-cropped viewer.

7. Document Viewer (Pop-out within Halo)
Requirements:

PDF/Image/Text support

Circular crop or rounded rectangular card masked inside halo

Citation panel on right side

Highlighted passages extracted by AI

“Add to Timeline”, “Add to Theory”, “Add to Binder” buttons

8. Trial Binder Creator

A simplified, beautiful, dark-mode folder system that:

Lets users designate exhibits

Auto-generates exhibit cover sheets

Organizes materials for presentation

Exports in TrialPad/OnCue-compatible structures

UI references:

Folder tree on left

Preview pane inside halo

Exhibit card grid hovering in front of halo

9. Technical Frontend Notes
Framework Recommendation

React + Three.js (for halo glow + orbital nodes)

Or standard React with SVG layers + blur filters

Animation Goals

Smooth 60fps

Glow bloom effects (CSS filter + optional WebGL bloom)

GPU friendly

Avoid clutter — maintain “black space” around halo

Component Requirements

NodeButton (primary modules)

SubNodeButton

HaloBoundary

ViewportContainer

GlowPulseEffect

SlideOutMenu

SettingsModal

DocumentViewer

AgentChatViewer

TimelineEditor

GraphCanvas

10. UX Navigation Summary

User Flow Example:

User lands on Home → sees full halo with primary modules on left.

Hover “Graph Explorer” → bright glow → user clicks.

Right side populates with submodules.

Center zooms into graph view.

User selects “Autonomous Query Panel” → viewport animates into a console-style screen within the halo.

User opens settings and adds API keys.

User returns to “Evidence Ingestion” → uploads a folder → pipeline activity animates around halo border.

User reviews citations → opens timeline → adds events → crosslinks to theory.

User enters Mock Trial → agents argue → user watches conversation viewer.

11. What the Next Mockup Should Include (for next PNG)

To ensure your next generated PNG is perfect:

Halo with left-side primary module nodes (glowing)

Right-side submodule nodes (inactive until module selected)

Central viewport placeholder

Top-right menu

Bottom-right settings cog

Dark, moody, cinematic environment

Variables for:

Graph

Chat viewer

Timeline

Document viewer

Trial university

Mock trial arena

Pipeline

You can tell me exactly which module you'd like rendered next, and I’ll generate another high-fidelity PNG mockup in that style.
