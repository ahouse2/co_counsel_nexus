# Rubric — Co‑Counsel Build (Scoring 1–10)

Each deliverable and feature is scored across these categories. Minimum acceptable average: 8.0; no category below 7 without a remediation plan.

1) Technical Accuracy — correctness vs. spec; logic; data handling
2) Modularity — low coupling, high cohesion; clear interfaces
3) Performance — latency, throughput, memory, I/O efficiency
4) Security — RBAC, secret management, auditability, least privilege
5) Scalability — data volumes, concurrency, horizontal scale
6) Robustness — error handling, retries, idempotency, resilience
7) Maintainability — clarity, tests, local reproducibility, docs
8) Innovation — meaningful improvement beyond baseline
9) UX/UI Quality — clarity, accessibility, aesthetics, responsiveness
10) Explainability — citations, graph paths, traceability
11) Coordination — inter‑agent handoffs, ACE adherence
12) DevOps Readiness — CI, build, releases, observability hooks
13) Documentation — PRPs/runbooks/usage completeness
14) Compliance — PII/PHI treatment, chain‑of‑custody, retention
15) Enterprise Value — commercial viability & polish
