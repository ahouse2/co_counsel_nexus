**Agent:** Gemini

**Task Completed:** Developed a beautiful and cinematic dark-mode frontend for the AI-powered legal discovery and trial platform, following provided design specifications and code snippets.

**Summary of Work:**

*   **Frontend Component Implementation:**
    *   Created and integrated `DashboardHub`, `MetricCard`, `UploadZone`, `GraphExplorer`, `MockTrialArena`, `TrialUniversityPanel`, and `LiveCoCounselChat` components.
    *   Implemented initial design specifications, including cinematic dark-mode styling, Framer Motion animations, and responsive layouts.
*   **Backend API Integration:**
    *   Connected `UploadZone` to the `/api/ingestion` endpoint for file uploads.
    *   Connected `GraphExplorer` to the `/api/graph/neighbors/{node_id}` endpoint for fetching graph data (with a hardcoded `node_id` for demonstration).
    *   Connected `MockTrialArena` to the `/api/scenarios` endpoint for listing and selecting scenarios.
    *   Connected `LiveCoCounselChat` to the `/api/agents/{agent_id}/run` endpoint for real-time chat interactions.
    *   `MetricCard` components currently use hardcoded data due to the generic nature of available backend endpoints for specific metrics.
*   **Code Quality and Conventions:**
    *   Adhered to existing project conventions for React/TypeScript development.
    *   Implemented basic error handling and loading states for API interactions.

**Areas for Future Refinement and Next Steps:**

1.  **Refine API Integrations:**
    *   **`UploadZone`**: Implement real-time progress tracking for file uploads and more robust handling of ingestion status updates.
    *   **`GraphExplorer`**: Develop a comprehensive 3D graph visualization using a dedicated library (e.g., `react-force-graph`, `vis.js`, `D3.js`). Implement dynamic `node_id` selection or a broader graph fetching mechanism.
    *   **`MockTrialArena`**: Fully implement the `handleRunScenario` function to execute scenarios via the `/api/scenarios/run` endpoint and process the simulation results (e.g., displaying live video/transcript streams).
    *   **`LiveCoCounselChat`**: Confirm the exact structure of `AgentRunRequest` and `AgentRunResponse` with the backend team. Implement chat history management using the `/agents/{agent_id}/threads` endpoint.
    *   **`MetricCard`**: Collaborate with the backend team to define specific API endpoints for dashboard metrics, or develop a strategy to derive these metrics from existing generic endpoints.
2.  **Styling Enhancements:**
    *   Define all custom CSS classes used in the components (e.g., `upload-zone`, `chat-panel`, `module-card`, `holoscreen-container`) within `frontend/src/styles/index.css` or dedicated module CSS files to ensure consistent and maintainable styling.
3.  **Testing:**
    *   Implement comprehensive unit tests for all new and modified frontend components.
    *   Set up and implement end-to-end (E2E) tests using Playwright to validate critical user flows and API integrations.
4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Update `README.md` and other relevant documentation to reflect the new frontend components, their functionalities, and integration points.

**Current Status:** The frontend prototype is functional and visually aligned with the cinematic dark-mode design. It provides a strong foundation for further development and refinement.
